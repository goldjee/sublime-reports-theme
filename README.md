# Sublime Reports Power BI theme

Here is Sublime Reports - a clean minimalistic theme for your Power BI reports. The idea behind this was to provide a framework of UI components with shared simple, yet good enough look. This theme heavily relies on common JSON properties across standard PBI visuals, so it is easy to modify and extend.

As you can see, there are two versions of this theme: regular and typographic. Use the regular one if you want to present your visuals as cards, and typographic for a cleaner newspaper-like appearance.
